# Personal Portfolio
A personal portfolio that was built with React, CSS, and HTML. This portfolio has been developed to display my coding achievements, projects that I have personally been working on as well as projects that I have developed while working through the open source [Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Courses](https://www.theodinproject.com/) <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/assets/icons/odin-icon-b5b31c073f7417a257003166c98cc23743654715305910c068b93a3bf4d3065d.svg"  width="20" height="20">. Particularly for this project, I wanted to explore and develop my skills in CSS animations and transformations, as well as ensure it functions across a wide range of devices and browsers.
